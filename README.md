## Webpack 5

**Preparations:** [Install node.js](https://docs.understrap.com/#/understrap-child/npm?id=preparations-install-nodejs)

At first you need node.js installed on your computer globally. If you already done this before skip this section. If not: You have to install node.js (comes along with npm) before you can proceed. To install node.js visit the node.js website for the latest installer for your OS. Download and install it like any other program, too.

We also recommend using [NVM - Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to keep closer control over your version of node.js and switch between versions.

**Installing dependencies**

* Make sure you have installed Node.js on your computer globally
* Then open your terminal and browse to the location of your projects
* Run: `npm install`
